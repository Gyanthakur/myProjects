						With the idea of imparting programming knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain,
						an IIT Roorkee alumnus started a dream, GeeksforGeeks. Whether
						programming excites you or you feel stifled, wondering how to
						prepare for interview questions or how to ace data structures and
						algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a one-stop solution. With every tick of
						time, we are adding arrows in our quiver. From articles on various
						computer science subjects to programming problems for practice, from
						basic to premium courses, from technologies to entrance
						examinations, we have been building ample content with superior
						quality. In a short span, we have built a community of 1 Million+
						Geeks around the world, 20,000+ Contributors and 500+ Campus
						Ambassadors in various colleges across the nation. Our success
						stories include a lot of students who benefitted in their placements
						and landed jobs at tech giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic
						network of geeks and we are only a fraction of it yet.
